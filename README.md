Team Collaboration Description:

Whiteboard Canvas- Here, all whiteList team members can draw, sketch, and brainstorm together in real-time. Whether it's illustrating ideas, mapping out strategies, or simply doodling, everyone's contributions appear instantly on each other's screens.

But that's not all - our document editor takes collaboration to the next level. With the ability for all whiteList users to write, edit, and format text simultaneously, creating documents has never been more efficient. Whether it's drafting reports, crafting proposals, or outlining strategies, every heading, paragraph, and edit is reflected instantly across all team members' screens.

And here's the best part - TeamCollab's automatic saving feature ensures that your work is always secure and up-to-date. When one user clicks on "Save File Changes," the updates are automatically saved for all whiteList users, no need for others to manually save. Even if three users haven't clicked on "Save File Changes," they'll still see the latest changes once they refresh the page, ensuring seamless collaboration without any hassle.

i will release the Live Project link soon
